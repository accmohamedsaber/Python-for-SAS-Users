# Python-for-SAS-Users
A repo of [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to help translate from the SAS statistical language to equivalents using Python libraries.

####Initial Topics:
- Installation / Execution
- Translation of commonly used SAS procedures to Python equivalents

####What won't be (initially) covered:
- Why learn Python?
- Technical/computational differences

###Philosophy:
- Is the essence of the program/procedure covered? I will not try to exactly replicate every exact detail of each SAS output.
