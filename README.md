# Python for SAS Users
This repository contains several [IPython Notebooks](http://ipython.org/notebook.html) to help translate from the SAS statistical language to equivalents using Python libraries.

It is best viewed using nbviewer, which you can access by [clicking here](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/pmbaumgartner/Python-for-SAS-Users/tree/master/).

### Initial Topics:
- Installation / Execution / Basic Syntax
- Tutorial based fundamentals course modeled off of UCLA's SAS Learning Modules
- Translation of commonly used SAS procedures to Python equivalents

### What won't be (initially) covered:
- Why learn Python?
- Technical/computational differences (Including speed differences)

### Philosophy:
- Is the essence of the program/procedure covered? Exact output replication is not the goal.
