    "## I'm here to learn Python and come from SAS. What should I know?\n",
    "There are a few things that will require you to *think* about programming differently. \n",
    "### Objects\n",
    "One twist is that we'll be doing a lot of object-oriented programming in SAS. Coming from SAS, the only thing I thought of as an *object* in the traditional sense was the dataset. I could read it in, apply procedures to it, and export it to a file (another object).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if the procedures I applied to the dataset were also objects that I could interact with? For example, instead of running `PROC LOGISTIC`, instead I interacted with a *Logistic Regression Object*. With this object I can call functions or methods on it to do things with it like fit it to data, predict new cases, or see its attributes (coefficients for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "This will become more clear after going through some examples, but hopefully it's at least got you thinking. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Toy Object Example**  \n",
    "The standard way to instantiate (create) an object is like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aNewCar = Car()`\n",
    "\n",
    "We now have an object called `aNewCar` that's a copy of the `Car` object. Let's assume that we can do something with this car like drive it, and our object has a `drive()` method. The standard way to call a method on an object is:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aNewCar.drive(mph=60)`\n",
    "\n",
    "I've also supplied an argument for the method, `mph=60`, telling it how fast I want it to drive. Not all methods have arguments, so you may often see:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aNewCar.stop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes also have attributes or data. To display an attribute a similar syntax is used, but attributes won't have parenthesis. Assuming our car has a `wheels` attribute, we could see what the value of it is by doing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`aNewCar.wheels`\n",
    "\n",
    "And this would return the number of wheels on our car (hopefully 4).\n",

    "### Imports\n",
    "This is also one of the more challenging aspects of transitioning to Python: importing modules and packages. In code you'll typically see three main ways of importing a module. \n",
    "\n",
    "** 1. Importing an entire module**  \n",
    "You may see an import like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import StringIO`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will import the entire `StringIO` module and create a reference to it. The documentation is a good place to see what classes and functions are available within that module. If we want to create an object of the `StringIO` class (confusingly from the `StringIO` module) we would do this after importing:\n",
    "\n",
    "`myString = StringIO.String()`\n",
    "\n",
    "It's similar to calling a function on a class, but also a bit different, since now `myString` is that object and we can still call functions on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 2. Importing an entire module and changing the reference name.**  \n",
    "You'll see this with the `pandas` package each time we import it. The statement will say:\n",
    "\n",
    "`import pandas as pd`\n",
    "\n",
    "This does the same as [1] but instead of referencing everything from the module by having to write `pandas.object`, we can now write `pd.object`. You may think that just makes us lazy, but when you type it a lot it saves a bunch of time. Plus everyone does it.\n",
    "\n",
    "** 3. Importing specific objects from modules **\n",
    "You'll see this when we start using the scikit-learn library. We almost never want to import the entire thing when we're only going to use single classes from it. For example, if we want to do a logistic regression, we'd type:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few things that may be confusing about this. First, `sklearn` is itself organized by modules, and the `LogisticRegression` class falls under the `linear_model` module. You'll also notice there are no parenthesis here since we're just importing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most importantly, we've imported the object itself directly into our namespace. Thus, we **do not** have to type something like `logit = sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression()`, but instead:\n",
    "\n",
    "`logit = LogisticRegression()`\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparison, we could have done the same thing with our StringIO object from example one and done the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`from StringIO import StringIO`  \n",
    "`myString = StringIO()`\n",
    "\n",
    "But this gets confusing and isn't really necessary since `StringIO` is not that large of a module.\n",
